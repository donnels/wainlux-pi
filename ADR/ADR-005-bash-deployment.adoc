= ADR-005: Bash Scripts for Deployment

== Status

Accepted

== Context

Single Pi Zero W. One Docker container. Need deployment automation?
Furher background.: IF someone else wants to use this simplicity will be better.

Options considered:

* OpenTofu/Terraform
* Ansible
* Balena
* Bash scripts
* Make

== Decision

Use bash scripts.

== Rationale

=== Requirements
* Deploy code to one device
* keep it standalone
* Build Docker image
* Start container
* View logs
* Low complexity

=== Why Bash

Simple. Direct. Fast.

50 lines does the job. No dependencies. Easy to debug. Runs anywhere.

OpenTofu adds 500+ lines. Needs state management. Overkill for one device.

Ansible better than Tofu. Still too much for one device.

Balena for fleets. We have one Pi.

Make just wraps bash. No gain.

=== Trade-offs

*Pros:*

* Zero dependencies
* Fast execution
* Easy debugging
* Self-contained
* Works in Flatpak
* Clear error messages
* No state files
* No abstractions

*Cons:*

* Manual for multiple devices
* No drift detection
* No declarative model
* Harder to test

=== When to Reconsider

Switch to Ansible at 3+ devices.

Never use Terraform/OpenTofu for this.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* Deployment works now
* Anyone can read the script
* Easy to modify
* No new tools to learn
* Follows KISS principle

=== Negative

* Manual sync for multi-device
* Script must handle errors
* No automatic rollback

=== Mitigation

* Add error handling to scripts
* Keep scripts short
* Document commands
* Use systemd for auto-restart

== Implementation

Scripts in `scripts/`:

* `deploy_to_pi.sh` - Full deployment
* `sync_with_pi.sh` - Bidirectional code sync (push/pull)
* `quick_deploy.sh` - Skip sync

All use standard tools: `ssh`, `scp`, `tar`, `docker`.

== Notes

This is the right tool for the job. Simple problem. Simple solution.

IaC tools solve different problems: multi-region cloud deployments, hundreds of resources, team coordination.

We have: one Pi, one container, one person.

Bash wins.
