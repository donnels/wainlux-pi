= ADR-004: No Database

== Status

Accepted

== Context

Web app needs state management. Could use database.

== Decision

Stateless design. No database.

== Rationale

*RAM:* 512MB total. Database uses 50-100MB.

*Purpose:* Real-time laser control, not job management.

*Complexity:* Database adds failure modes.

*State:* Restart clears state. This is acceptable for single-user local control.

Jobs run immediately. No queue. No persistence needed.

== Consequences

*Positive:*
* Lower memory usage
* Simpler deployment
* Fewer dependencies
* Faster restarts

*Negative:*
* No job history
* No job queue
* Must re-upload after restart

== Mitigation

CSV logs provide burn history.

User workflow is immediate: upload → burn → done.

For job queues, add database later if needed.
