= ADR-001: Base Image Selection

== Status

Accepted

== Context

Pi Zero W is ARMv6. *Not a choice - it's what we have.* Hardware constraint, not decision.

Given Pi Zero W, need Docker base image.

.Options considered
* Alpine Linux
* Official Raspberry Pi images (raspbian/bullseye)
* Balena IoT images
* Debian slim
* Ubuntu (if ARMv7+ available)

== Decision

Use `balenalib/raspberry-pi:bullseye`.

== Rationale

*ARMv6 support:* Pi Zero W requirement. Alpine dropped ARMv6 in 3.13+. Ubuntu doesn't support ARMv6.

*Size:* 120MB vs 200MB+ official Raspberry Pi images. Debian slim 180MB.

*Tested:* Balena production-tested for IoT. Official images stable but heavier.

*Build time:* Pre-built layers save hours on first build vs building from scratch.

*Maintenance:* Balena actively maintains ARMv6 images for IoT fleet.

Considered Alpine (smallest) but ARMv6 support dropped. Would need to pin old version (risky).

Official Raspberry Pi images work fine but 80MB larger for minimal gain.

Debian slim is middle ground but not IoT-optimized.

== Consequences

.*Positive*
* Stable ARMv6 platform
* Smaller image = faster builds
* IoT-optimized base
* Active maintenance

.*Negative*
* Balena-specific (less common than Alpine/Debian)
* Locked to Balena update schedule

*Trade-off accepted:* ARMv6 support and size win outweigh platform specificity.
