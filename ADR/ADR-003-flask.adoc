= ADR-003: Flask vs FastAPI

== Status

Accepted

== Context

Need web framework for Pi Zero W (512MB RAM).

.Options
* Flask
* FastAPI
* Django

== Decision

Use Flask.

== Rationale

*Memory:* Flask uses 40MB less RAM than FastAPI.

*Async:* Don't need async. Serial communication is synchronous. Single laser. One job at a time.

*Simplicity:* Flask proven on Pi Zero. Minimal dependencies.

*Speed:* FastAPI async overhead wasted on serial I/O.

Django too heavy for this use case.

== Consequences

Lower memory footprint on constrained hardware.

Simpler code without async complexity.

Single-threaded model matches serial hardware constraints.
