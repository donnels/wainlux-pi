Test results and experiments with various materials under the K6 laser.

== Cork Material

Cork marks easily where paper does not at the same settings.

The pulsed nature of the beam is visible in close-up shots. The following image shows a test QR code pattern.

The pattern is functional but not optimal at low power settings. Text and lines at higher settings show less spotty, more burnt appearance. Initial scale experiments resulted in smaller-than-expected output.

== PLA Material

PLA filament responds differently to laser engraving than cork. The pulsed line structure is visible in close-up shots of the tiger test image.

In the above image you can clearly see the pulsed nature of the laser and how it melted the PLA.

The tiger image shows good detail at low to medium power settings. The melted areas have a shiny finish.
