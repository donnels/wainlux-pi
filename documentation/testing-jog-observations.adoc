= Jog Testing Observations
:toc:

== Coordinate System Behavior

=== Normal Operation (Soft Limits ON)
* X-axis: 0-1600px (0-80mm @ 0.05mm/px)
* Y-axis: 0-1600px (0-80mm @ 0.05mm/px)

=== Soft Limits OFF (Experimental)

WARNING: When soft limits are disabled, negative coordinates produce inverted movement and physical bounds contact.

==== Negative X Movement
* setting: 10mm hops
* Command: Move to negative X coordinates
* Actual behavior: Laser head moves to *positive X* extreme
* Result: Physical contact with right-side bounds
* Audible feedback: continuous

==== Negative Y Movement
* setting: 10mm hops
* Command: Move to negative Y coordinates (toward top)
* Actual behavior: Laser head moves *down* 
* Result: Physical contact with bottom bounds
* Audible feedback: continuous

==== Positive Bounds Testing
* setting: 10mm hops
* X-axis: Audible feedback for 2 jogs beyond 1600px, then silent
* Y-axis: Audible feedback at steps 8-10 beyond 1600px
* **Observation**: Y-axis appears more physically limited than X-axis

== Connection State

=== CONNECT Command (0x0A)
* *Not required* for jog/bounds commands to work
* Device accepts movement commands even when "disconnected"
* Purpose: Helps establish sane device state
* Not strictly enforced by firmware

=== Testing Notes
* Can turn laser off/on and continue jogging
* CONNECT helpful but not mandatory
* Connection tracking is client-side only

== Protocol Interpretation

=== BOUNDS (0x20)
* Function: Enable preview/framing mode
* Effect: Shows burn area outline without firing laser
* Used for: Positioning and alignment

=== FRAMING (0x21)
* Function: Disable preview/framing mode
* Effect: Stops BOUNDS preview, returns to idle
* Used for: Clearing preview state before burns
* Already in burn sequence to disable bounds checking

=== CROSSHAIR (0x06/0x07)
* Status: No observed effect
* Purpose: Testing only, not production
* Clearing: Not necessary - if set, it's intentional for testing
* Note: Left alone per YAGNI principle

== Recommendations

. Use soft limits unless specifically testing edge cases
. Negative coordinates produce unexpected inverted movement
. Y-axis has less physical travel than X-axis
. CONNECT at session start for clean state, but not required for every operation
. FRAMING (0x21) before burns is sufficient state clearing
