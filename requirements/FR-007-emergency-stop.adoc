* Cancel Python burn loop via threading event
* Send CONNECT command to reset device state
* Works during upload phase
* Works during burn phase
* Returns device to safe idle state
* No material damage from incomplete burn

== Rationale

* Safety: stop burn immediately if fire/smoke detected
* User error: wrong material, wrong positioning
* Testing: cancel test burns quickly

== Related ADRs

* ADR-011: UI color and goggles (STOP button always visible)
* ADR-012: Pipeline architecture (cancel flag)

== Implementation

* `/api/test/stop` - stop endpoint
* `burn_cancel_event` threading event
* Driver checks event in burn loop
* CONNECT command resets device
