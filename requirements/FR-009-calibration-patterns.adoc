= FR-009: Test Pattern Generation

== Status

Implemented

== Description

Generate calibration and test patterns for alignment, focus, and hardware validation.

== Acceptance Criteria

* **Center pattern**: Small box with crosshair in center of work area
* **Corners pattern**: Boxes in all four corners
* **Frame pattern**: Full work area outline
* **Grid pattern**: Graph paper lines at configurable spacing
* **Bottom-test pattern**: Diagonal line at Y-axis limit (tests cropping)
* Configurable resolution (mm/px)
* Configurable size (mm)
* Preview before burn

== Rationale

* Alignment: position material correctly
* Focus: test laser focus at different positions
* Limits: verify work area boundaries
* Debugging: test Y-axis cropping issues

== Related ADRs

* ADR-012: Pipeline architecture (calibration uses standard workflow)

== Implementation

* `/api/calibration/generate` - pattern generation
* `/api/calibration/burn` - burn pattern
* `/api/calibration/preview` - BOUNDS preview
* `PatternService` - pattern generation (DRY)
* Patterns use standard engrave workflow
* Work area: 1600×1520px measured limits
