= Requirements

Functional (FR) and Non-Functional (NFR) requirements.

Short. Clear. Rebuildable.

== Structure

* `FR-###-name.adoc` - Functional requirements
* `NFR-###-name.adoc` - Non-functional requirements

Each requirement has:

* *Description* - 1-2 sentences, what is needed
* *Acceptance criteria* - bullets, testable conditions
* *Status* - proposed | accepted | implemented
* *Related ADRs* - decisions that implement this requirement

== TOGAF Compliance

Requirements traceability:

* FR/NFR → ADR (decision implements requirement)
* ADR → Code (implementation follows decision)
* Code → Test (validation proves acceptance)

Iterative: Requirements evolve. Add new FR/NFR as features emerge. No waterfall.
