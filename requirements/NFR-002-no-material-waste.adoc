= NFR-002: No Material Waste in Testing

== Status

Implemented

== Description

Test workflows must not waste engraving material or time.

== Acceptance Criteria

* Dry run mode uploads data without firing laser
* Preview mode (BOUNDS 0x20) shows positioning without burn
* Pipeline stages testable without device
* Command replay without re-processing
* Unit tests without hardware

== Rationale

* Material costs money
* Test burns waste time (~50 min per 1600x1600)
* Early testing before production runs
* Safe calibration and pattern testing

== Implementation

* Dry run toggle (FR-004)
* BOUNDS command for positioning
* Pipeline architecture (FR-003)
* Mock transport for unit tests

== Related ADRs

* ADR-012: Pipeline architecture

== Measurements

* Full burn (1600x1600): ~5 minutes + material
* Dry run (1600x1600): ~30 seconds, no material
* BOUNDS preview: <1 second, no material
