= NFR-001: Pi Zero W Performance

== Status

Accepted

== Description

System must run on Pi Zero W (ARMv6, 512MB RAM, single-core 1GHz).

== Constraints

* ARMv6 architecture (limits base images)
* 512MB RAM (limits dependencies)
* Single-core (no parallelism)
* Slow build (~15-20 min for Docker image)

== Acceptance Criteria

* Docker image builds on Pi Zero W
* Flask app runs with <200MB RAM
* Image processing completes in <10 seconds for 1600x1600px
* No heavy dependencies (no TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
* Responsive UI on local network

== Mitigations

* NumPy for vectorized operations (90s → 1s for 1600x1600)
* Balena base image (ARMv6 support)
* Minimal Python dependencies
* Pre-built Docker layers

== Related ADRs

* ADR-001: Base image selection
* ADR-009: Docker containerization

== Measurements

* Image threshold (1600x1600): ~1 second (NumPy)
* Bit packing (1600x1600): ~0.5 seconds
* Serial upload (1600 lines): ~5 minutes
