= FR-004: Dry Run Without Laser

== Status

Implemented

== Description

Test burn sequence without firing laser. Upload data, test protocol, verify commands, but skip laser ignition.

== Acceptance Criteria

* Toggle dry run mode in settings
* Execute full protocol sequence (FRAMING, JOB_HEADER, CONNECT, DATA)
* Skip INIT commands (0x24) that start laser
* Device receives all data, laser never fires
* Return success with "dry run" indicator
* Works with all burn operations (image, QR, calibration)

== Rationale

* Test protocol without wasting material
* Verify data upload pipeline
* Calibrate timing without risk
* Debug new patterns safely

== Related ADRs

* ADR-012: Pipeline architecture (dry run as driver flag)

== Implementation

* `driver.dry_run` property (driver-level flag)
* `device_manager.dry_run` syncs to driver
* Driver checks `self.dry_run` before INIT commands
* Service/workflow layers unaware (separation of concerns)
