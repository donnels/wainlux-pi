= FR-003: Pipeline Visibility and Progress Tracking

== Status

Implemented (Consolidated from FR-003, FR-008)

== Description

Expose burn pipeline stages. Show real-time progress. Test independently. Save/replay jobs.

== Acceptance Criteria

* 4-step pipeline: upload → process → build → execute
* Each step saves file, returns preview + metadata
* Execute from saved .bin without re-processing
* Three modes: silent, verbose, single-step
* Real-time SSE progress stream
* Three phases: setup (0-100%), upload (0-100%), burning (0-100%)
* Device status parsing (FF FF 00 XX frames)
* Keepalive events every 30s

== Rationale

* Test stages without device/burns
* Debug failures at specific stage
* Replay with different parameters
* User feedback for long burns (5+ min)
* See where burns fail
* Time estimates

== Implementation

* `/api/engrave/prepare` - Step 1
* `/api/pipeline/process` - Step 2
* `/api/pipeline/build` - Step 3
* `/api/pipeline/execute` - Step 4
* `/api/progress/stream` - SSE endpoint
* `PipelineService` - file-based workflow
* `ProgressCSVLogger` - emits progress events
* `emit_progress()` - queue events
* Three progress bars in UI
