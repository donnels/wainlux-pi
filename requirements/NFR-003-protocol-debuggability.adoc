= NFR-003: Protocol Debuggability

== Status

Implemented

== Description

Serial protocol must be debuggable. Capture all I/O for reverse-engineering and troubleshooting.

== Acceptance Criteria

* Capture raw serial I/O (send and receive)
* Log timing of all operations
* Interpret device responses (ACK/ERROR/HEARTBEAT/STATUS)
* Save to human-readable format
* No filtering or validation (raw data only)
* Works in verbose mode automatically

== Rationale

* Vendor protocol undocumented
* Firmware bugs need proof
* Reverse-engineering new commands
* Timing analysis for optimization

== Implementation

* `ByteDumpLogger` - raw I/O capture (.dump + .dump.txt)
* `CSVLogger` - timing and operation log
* Verbose mode saves all logs automatically
* No validation in byte logger (pure capture)

== Related ADRs

* ADR-002: Serial communication
* ADR-006: Clean room protocol
* ADR-012: Pipeline architecture

== Format

* `.dump` - binary capture
* `.dump.txt` - hex + decimal + interpretation
* `.csv` - timing, phase, operation, bytes_transferred
